## Details

Exports the current model's applications and relations as a reusable bundle.

The bundle does not mirror the model configuration. It is a self-contained
definition derived from the applications currently deployed in the model, so
that the same set of applications and relations can be reproduced in another
model.

Juju may optimise how information is represented in the exported bundle.
For example, if all applications share the same base, Juju may set a
bundle-level default-base. 

Exposure rules and application offers may
also be captured in an overlay as a second YAML document within the same
file (for example, using exposed-endpoints and offers entries). These
optimisations change only how the bundle is expressed and do not affect
the resulting deployment.

If `--filename` is not used, the configuration is printed to `stdout`.
` --filename` specifies an output file.
