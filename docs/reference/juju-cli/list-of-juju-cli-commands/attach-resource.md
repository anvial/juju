## Details

This command updates a resource for an application.

The format is

    <resource name>=<resource>

where `<resource name>` is the name from the `metadata.yaml` (`charmcraft.yaml`) file of the charm and `<resource>` is the resource itself, which can be supplied as follows:

- For a resource type `file`:

    a. that has been uploaded to Charmhub: the resource revision number.

    b. that is local to your machine: a path to the local file. Caveat: If you choose this, you will
	not be able to go back to using a resource from Charmhub.

- For a resource type `oci-image`:

    a. that has been uploaded to Charmhub: the resource revision number.

	b. that is local to your machine: a path to the local `json` or `yaml` file
	that contains the details for your private OCI image (local image path, username, password, etc.).
	Caveat: If you choose this, you will not be able to go back to using a resource from Charmhub.

    c. For a resource that has been uploaded to a public OCI registry: a link to the public OCI image.
	Caveat: If you choose this, you will not be able to go back to using a resource from Charmhub.
